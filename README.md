Rutgers Data Sciences Bootcamp, Module 19 Challenge (11 July 2023)


In this challenge, we use Python (Jupyter Notebook) and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Data is loaded from the supplied csv file, then plotted to see what our dataset looks like. The data is then normalized and scaled into a dataframe to begin data analysis and perform the following:

- Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
- Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
